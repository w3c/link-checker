	  4.01 Strict and ISO-HTML.

2003-11-24 21:11  ville

	* checklink.pl: Fix HTML "escaping" of URIs.  Some were escaped
	  twice, some not at all.

2003-11-22 17:40  ville

2003-09-15 21:31  ville

	* checklink.pl: Unbreak --masquerade, enhance documentation and
	  error messages.  W3C Bugzilla #340, Debian bug #187791, thanks to
	  Dan Jacobson and Frederic Schutz for the report.

2003-09-12 20:49  ville

	* checklink.pl: Make the configuration file optional.  Thanks to
	  Hugo Haas for the heads up.  Also, load Config::General only if
	  needed.

2003-09-11 13:46  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Fixing the following: [Thu Sep 11 12:44:53 2003]
	  checklink.pl: Argument "help" isn't numeric in exit at
	  /home/hugo/bin/checklink.pl line 410.

2003-07-27 19:19  ville

	* checklink.pl: Don't conditionalize the Term::ReadKey requirement,
	  but defer its loading until actually needed.	system('stty')
	  doesn't work under -T without laundering $ENV{PATH}, and I don't
	  feel like going there :P

	  Also, don't load CGI and CGI::Carp in command line mode; defer by
	  using require() instead of use().

2003-07-27 18:38  ville

	* checklink.pl: Implement option to disallow checking non-public IP
	  addresses; disallow by default in CGI mode and allow in command
	  line mode.

	  New requirement: Net::IP.

2003-07-26 22:20  ville

	* checklink.pl: Use Text::Wrap for beautifying command line output,
	  some other output tweaks.

2003-07-26 22:16  ville

	* checklink.pl: Fix redirect loop detection, and add a descriptive
	  error message.

	  Previously, only loops like L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> L1 were detected;
	  ones like L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> L2 resulted in infinite recursion.

	  Fixes <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=188372>,
	  thanks to Dan Jacobson and Frederic Schutz for reporting this.

2003-07-26 18:48  ville

	  environment variables in order to support news: URIs without
	  explicit hostnames under -T.

2003-06-15 17:42  ville

	* checklink.pl: Call get_timestamp always without arguments.

2003-06-02 20:27  ville

	* checklink.pl: -? == --help, be a bit more verbose with the usage
	  of --location and --recursive (Debian bug report #189642).

2003-05-24 23:32  link

	* checklink.pl: Merging from validator-0_6_0-branch, at tag
	  validator-0_6_2-beta1, to HEAD.

2003-02-05 23:47  ville

	* checklink.pl: Skip 'base' tags with empty hrefs (#138).  Put HTML
	  validity a bit more prominently into beginning of results page.

2003-02-02 21:03  ville

	* checklink.pl: - Implemented external configuration file stuff
	  (#127).    We now require Config::General >= 2.06.  - Fixed basic
	  authentication (#122).  If the trusted domain is not specificed,
	  we only send the authentication to the same host which requested
	  it.	 Also added a notice about this to the error page/command
	  line message if    no suitable authentication info was given.  -
	  Changed text/javascript to application/x-javascript, thanks to
	  Nicolas Roeser for the report.    (see
	  <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2003Jan/0158.html>)
	  - Fixed missing results from the summary when a file:// URI was
	  present   (also reduces number of error log warnings emitted).  -

	  cleanups.

	* checklink.pl: - Fix multiple brainos in cookie code.

2002-12-08 16:47  ville

	* checklink.pl: - Rewrote recursion scope checking, was failing
	  with URIs with no slash after   the hostname; eg.
	  <http://validator.w3.org> caused checklink to wander to   other
	  sites (#115).  - Report CVS revision as version number.

2002-12-07 21:55  ville

	* checklink.pl: - Send Accept: application/xhtml+xml, text/html,
	  */*;q=0.5 (#112) - Sanitize Accept-Language headers; either send
	  the ones from a browser or *.    In command line mode, really
	  default to * and send the ones given with    the command line
	  option. (#110)  - Add messages for codes 303 (#111), 307 and 406
	  (#55).  - Add "for" attribute for all <label>'s and the
	  corresponding id's so that   MSIE users can enjoy clicking the
	  labels.  - Some internal cleanup.

2002-11-23 23:37  ville

	* checklink.pl: - Options can be saved in a cookie (#56).  - Added
	  a JavaScript check against submitting empty URIs.  - Style
	  tweaks, ala Validator.  - Point to new docs location (relative).

2002-11-23 17:06  ville

	* checklink.pl: - Tweak "form page" layout.  - Don't say "Valid
	  anchors!" if no anchors found.  - Fix HTML output from command
	  line.

	* checklink.pl: Output and style nits.

2002-10-27 15:04  ville

	* checklink.pl: Removed the debug logic and reworked the guess
	  whether the script is being run as a CGI or from the command
	  line; the problems this caused outweigh its usefulness [1].  Oh,
	  and this fixes #26.

	  [1] <http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13914>

2002-10-27 14:08  ville

	* checklink.pl: Unbreak the source download link (introduced in my
	  previous commit).  Found by checking the output of checklink with
	  itself.  Yay :)

2002-10-27 12:55  ville

	* checklink.pl: - Load Getopt::Long only in command line mode.	-
	  Tighter lexical scoping for variables.  - Output version/revision
	  number consistently everywhere.

2002-10-27 01:43  ville

	  use()'s, added missing ones.

2002-10-26 22:19  ville

	* checklink.pl: Swap $REVISION and $VERSION in order to be more
	  consistent with Perl stuff in general, make sure that we have at
	  least two digits in the version number.

	* checklink.pl: Whitespace only (reindentation).

2002-10-26 21:29  ville

	* checklink.pl: Portability update, now actually works on Win2K.

	  Term::ReadKey is now used for reading the password from the
	  command line if it is available, falling back to stty if it
	  isn't.

2002-10-23 23:31  ville

	* checklink.pl: Fix all function prototypes, and remove them from
	  methods.

	* checklink.pl: Made the "Summary only" function do the same as
	  John <rowe@excc.ex.ac.uk>'s quiet function from:
	  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2001JanMar/0261.html
	  This is a tiny change.

2001-03-27 01:33  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Added a --depth option based on the patch provided
	  by John <rowe@excc.ex.ac.uk>:
	  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2001JanMar/0261.html

	  Had to tweak it to make the combination of -r and -D work.

2001-03-27 00:39  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Maybe the base element problem is going to go away
	  completely now.  I have added a change by John
	  <rowe@excc.ex.ac.uk> which basically does not trust
	  HTTP::Response's base function, and it seems to be the way to go.

2001-01-22 18:00  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Fixed typo

2001-01-22 17:58  hugo

2001-01-18 23:58  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Committing changes that I made a long time ago...

	  - Added 410 HTTP error code in the list of errors.  - Simplified
	  a few regular expressions (got rid of some /'s).  - Added support
	  for //... URI's.  - Commented a bit more the code because I was
	  getting lost.  - Simplified already_processed().  - Added a
	  --hide-same-realm option: hide 401's that are in the same
	  realm as the document checked.  - Added a --masquerade option to
	  check documents on the local system	  as if they were on the
	  Web (based on a patch by David Carlisle     <davidc@nag.co.uk>).
	  Example:     checklink -q -b --masquerade
	  /afs/w3.org/pub/WWW/Math/Group/draft/cr/
	  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-MathML2-20001113/ appendixe.html -
	  500 errors are now split in two cases: DNS problems (LWP reports
	     that as a 500...) and real internal server errors.  - Fixed a
	  footer problem in the online problem.  - Fixed a duplicate id
	  problem in the error code references.

2000-09-25 20:38  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Undid change done in 2.62 about base tag handling.

	  HTTP::Headers::authorization_basic

	  Added a heading for anchors report.

2000-05-05 01:29  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Now uses the version 3 of the API of HTML::Parser.
	  Got rid of the chunk stuff, since the new parser doesn't care
	  about the   size of the data parsed (good).  Added attributes
	  checked. Still not perfect, but better.  Fixed a display bug in
	  the text version.  Now parses <?xml:stylesheet ...?>. I'm not

	  problems.  Added links to HTML Validator and CSS Validator.

	* checklink.pl: Better handling of doctypes.

2000-03-20 22:55  hugo

	* checklink.pl: I knew I would break something changing the data
	  structures: I love it when a plan comes together! Fixed a table
	  display problem.

2000-03-02 01:15  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Fixed authentication problem.  Added a limit for
	  the number of documents checked with the online version.  Fixed

	  <ion@ams.org>)

2000-02-09 01:11  hugo

	* checklink.pl: Changed the default for HTML version to "Show
	  redirects"

2000-02-08 23:48  hugo
