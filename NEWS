Version 4.1
- Added workarounds against browser timeouts in "summary only" mode.
- Improved caching and reuse of fetched /robots.txt information.
- Fixed a bug where a complete protocol response (including headers)
  was passed to the HTML parser, which caused unexpected behaviour.
- Minor user interface and installation related improvements.
