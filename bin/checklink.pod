=head1 NAME

checklink - check the validity of links in an HTML or XHTML document

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<checklink>  [ I<options> ] I<URI> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<checklink> command.

B<checklink> is a program that reads an HTML or XHTML document,
extracts a list of anchors and lists and checks that no anchor is
defined twice and that all the links are dereferenceable, including
the fragments. It warns about HTTP redirects, including directory
redirects, and can check recursively a part of a web site.

The program can be used either as a command-line version or as a CGI script.

=head1 OPTIONS

This program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

=over 5

=item B<-?, -h, --help>

Show summary of options.

=item B<-V, --version>

Output version information.

=item B<-s, --summary>

Result summary only.

=item B<-b, --broken>

Show only the broken links, not the redirects.

=item B<-e, --directory>

Hide directory redirects - e.g. L<http://www.w3.org/TR> ->
L<http://www.w3.org/TR/>.

=item B<-r, --recursive>

Check the documents linked from the first one.

=item B<-D, --depth n>

Check the documents linked from the first one to depth n
(implies --recursive).

=item B<-l, --location uri>

Scope of the documents checked in recursive mode. By default, for
L<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/Overview.html> for example, it would be
L<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/>.

=item B<-n, --noacclanguage>

Do not send an Accept-Language header.

=item B<-L, --languages>

Languages accepted (default: '*').

=item B<-q, --quiet>

No output if no errors are found.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Verbose mode.

=item B<-i, --indicator>

Show progress while parsing.

=item B<-u, --user username>

Specify a username for authentication.

=item B<-p, --password password>

Specify a password.

=item B<--hide-same-realm>

Hide 401's that are in the same realm as the document checked.

=item B<-t, --timeout value>

Timeout for the HTTP requests.

=item B<-d, --domain domain>

Regular expression describing the domain to which the authentication
information will be sent.  The default value can be specified in the
checklink configuration file.

=item B<--masquerade "local remote">

Masquerade local dir as a remote URI.  For example, the following results in
/my/local/dir/ being "mapped" to http://some/remote/uri/

  --masquerade "/my/local/dir http://some/remote/uri/"

As of revision 3.6.2.19 of checklink, --masquerade takes a single
argument consisting of two URIs, separated by whitespace.  One usual way of
providing a value with embedded whitespace is to enclose it in quotes.

=item B<-y, --proxy proxy>

Specify an HTTP proxy server.

=item B<-H, --html>

HTML output.

=head1 FILES

=over 5

=item F</etc/w3c/checklink.conf>

The main configuration file.  You can use the L<W3C_CHECKLINK_CFG> environment
variable to override the default location.

C<Trusted> specifies a regular expression for
matching trusted domains (ie. domains where HTTP basic authentication, if
any, will be sent).  For example, the following configures only the w3.org
domain as trusted:

    Trusted = \.w3\.org$

C<Allow_Private_IPs> is a boolean flag indicating whether checking links
on non-public IP addresses is allowed.  The default is true in command line
mode and false when run as a CGI script.  For example, to disallow checking
non-public IP addresses, regardless of the mode, use:

   Allow_Private_IPs = 0

C<Markup_Validator_URI> and C<CSS_Validator_URI> are formatted URIs to the
respective validators.  The %s in these will be replaced with the full
"URI encoded" URI to the document being checked, and shown in the link
checker results view in the online/CGI version.  The defaults are:

   Markup_Validator_URI =
     http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=%s
   CSS_Validator_URI =
     http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=%s

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

checklink uses the libwww-perl library which has a number of environment
variables affecting its behaviour.  See L</"SEE ALSO"> for some
pointers.

=over 5

=item B<W3C_CHECKLINK_CFG>

If set, overrides the path to the configuration file.
