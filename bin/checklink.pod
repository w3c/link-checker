=head1 NAME

checklink - check the validity of links in an HTML or XHTML document

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<checklink>  [ I<options> ] I<uri> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<checklink> command, a.k.a. the
W3C® Link Checker.

B<checklink> is a program that reads an HTML or XHTML document,
extracts a list of anchors and links and checks that no anchor is
defined twice and that all the links are dereferenceable, including
the fragments. It warns about HTTP redirects, including directory
redirects, and can check recursively a part of a web site.

The program can be used either as a command line tool or as a CGI script.

=head1 OPTIONS

This program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

=over 5

=item B<-?, -h, --help>

Show summary of options.

=item B<-V, --version>

Output version information.

=item B<-s, --summary>

Show result summary only.

=item B<-b, --broken>

Show only the broken links, not the redirects.

=item B<-e, --dir-redirects>

Hide directory redirects - e.g. L<http://www.w3.org/TR> ->
L<http://www.w3.org/TR/>.

=item B<-r, --recursive>

Check the documents linked from the first one.

=item B<-D, --depth> I<n>

Check the documents linked from the first one to depth I<n>
(implies B<--recursive>).

=item B<-l, --location> I<uri>

Scope of the documents checked (implies B<--recursive>).
Can be specified multiple times in order to specify multiple recursion
bases.  If the URI of a candidate document is downwards relative to any of
the bases, it is considered to be within the scope.  If not specified, the
default is the base URI of the initial document, for example for
L<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/Overview.html> it would be
L<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/>.

=item B<-X, --exclude> I<regexp>

Do not check links whose full, canonical URIs match I<regexp>.  Note that
this option limits recursion the same way as B<--exclude-docs> with the same
regular expression would.

=item B<--exclude-docs> I<regexp>

In recursive mode, do not check links in documents whose full, canonical
URIs match I<regexp>.  This option may be specified multiple times.

=item B<--suppress-redirect> I<URI-E<gt>URI>

Do not report a redirect from the first to the second URI.  The "-E<gt>" is
literal text.  This option may be specified multiple times.  Whitespace may
be used instead of "-E<gt>" to separate the URIs.

=item B<--suppress-redirect-prefix> I<URI-E<gt>URI>

Do not report a redirect from a child of the first URI to the same child of
the second URI.  The \"->\" is literal text.  This option may be specified
multiple times.  Whitespace may be used instead of "-E<gt>" to separate the
URIs.

=item B<--suppress-temp-redirects>

Do not report warnings about temporary redirects.

=item B<--suppress-broken> I<CODE:URI>

Do not report a broken link with the given CODE.  CODE is the HTTP
response, or -1 for robots exclusion.  The ":" is literal text.  This
option may be specified multiple times.  Whitespace may be used instead of
":" to separate the CODE and the URI.

=item B<--suppress-fragment> I<URI>

Do not report the given broken fragment URI.  A fragment URI contains "#".
This option may be specified multiple times.

=item B<-L, --languages> I<accept-language>

The C<Accept-Language> HTTP header to send.  In command line mode,
this header is not sent by default.  The special value C<auto> causes
a value to be detected from the C<LANG> environment variable, and sent
if found.  In CGI mode, the default is to send the value received from
the client as is.

=item B<-c, --cookies> I<cookie-file>

Use cookies, load/save them in I<cookie-file>.  The special value
C<tmp> causes non-persistent use of cookies, i.e. they are used but
only stored in memory for the duration of this link checker run.

=item B<-R, --no-referer>

Do not send the C<Referer> HTTP header.

=item B<-q, --quiet>

No output if no errors are found.  Implies B<--summary>.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Verbose mode.

=item B<-i, --indicator>

Show progress while parsing as percentage of lines processed.  No
indicator is shown for documents containing no linefeeds.

=item B<-u, --user> I<username>

Specify a username for authentication.

=item B<-p, --password> I<password>

Specify a password for authentication.

=item B<--hide-same-realm>

Hide 401's that are in the same realm as the document checked.

=item B<-S, --sleep> I<secs>

Sleep the specified number of seconds between requests to each server.
Defaults to 1 second, which is also the minimum allowed.

=item B<-t, --timeout> I<secs>

Timeout for requests, in seconds.  The default is 30.

=item B<-C, --connection-cache> I<number>

Maximum number of cached connections.  Using this option overrides the
C<Connection_Cache_Size> configuration file parameter, see its
documentation below for the default value and more information.

=item B<-d, --domain> I<domain>

Perl regular expression describing the domain to which the authentication
information (if present) will be sent.  The default value can be specified
in the configuration file.  See the C<Trusted> entry in the configuration
file description below for more information.

=item B<--masquerade> I<"real-prefix surrogate-prefix">

Perform a simple string substitution: URIs which begin with the
string C<real-prefix> are rewritten using the C<surrogate-prefix>
before being dereferenced.  Useful for making a local
directory masquerade as a remote one. For example:

  --masquerade "http://example.com/x/y/z/ file:///my/local/dir/"

If the document being checked contains a link to
http://example.com/x/y/z/foo.html, then the local file system will be
checked for file:///my/local/dir/foo.html.

B<--masquerade> takes a single argument consisting of two URIs,
separated by whitespace.  The quote marks are not part of the
argument, but one usual way of providing a value with embedded
whitespace is to enclose it in quotes.

=item B<-H, --html>

HTML output.

=head1 FILES

=over 5

=item F</etc/w3c/checklink.conf>

The main configuration file.  You can use the L<W3C_CHECKLINK_CFG> environment
variable to override the default location.

C<Trusted> specifies a regular expression for matching trusted domains
(ie. domains where HTTP basic authentication, if any, will be sent).
The regular expression will be matched case insensitively against host
names.  The default behavior (when unset, that is) is to send the
authentication information only to the host which requests it; usually
you don't want to change this.  For example, the following configures
I<only> the w3.org domain as trusted:

    Trusted = \.w3\.org$

C<Allow_Private_IPs> is a boolean flag indicating whether checking links
on non-public IP addresses is allowed.  The default is true in command line
mode and false when run as a CGI script.  For example, to disallow checking
non-public IP addresses, regardless of the mode, use:

   Allow_Private_IPs = 0

C<Forbidden_Protocols> is a comma separated list of additional protocols/URI
schemes that the link checker is not allowed to use.  The C<javascript> and
C<mailto> schemes are always forbidden, and so is the C<file> scheme when
running as a CGI script.

   Forbidden_Protocols = javascript,mailto

C<Markup_Validator_URI> and C<CSS_Validator_URI> are formatted URIs to the
respective validators.  The C<%s> in these will be replaced with the full
"URI encoded" URI to the document being checked, and shown in the link
checker results view in the online/CGI version.  The defaults are:

   Markup_Validator_URI =
     http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=%s
   CSS_Validator_URI =
     http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=%s

C<Doc_URI> is a URI used for linking to the documentation, and CSS and
JavaScript files in the dynamically generated content of the link checker.
The default is:

   Doc_URI = http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink.html

C<Connection_Cache_Size> is an integer denoting the maximum number of
connections the link checker will keep open at any given time.  The
default is:

   Connection_Cache_Size = 2

variables affecting its behaviour.  See L</"SEE ALSO"> for some

=item B<W3C_CHECKLINK_CFG>
